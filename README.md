I have in this repository the code wrote at the course Test Architecture with Protractor, by Walmyr L. S. Filho (https://www.udemy.com/course/arquitetura-de-testes-com-protractor/) - in Portuguese

## Protractor
"Protractor is an end-to-end test framework for Angular and AngularJS applications. Protractor runs tests against your application running in a real browser, interacting with it as a user would." - https://www.protractortest.org/#/

It's necessary these follow systems:
- Node.js and NPM

- In the directory, run 'npm install'. It installs the project dependencies
